## Level 5 Questions

### Explain what the REST architecture is, and explain the role of resources (represented by URLs); methods (e.g. GET and POST); and representations (e.g. JSON) in this architecture.


###  Explain what a REST backend is.


### Give 5 examples of publicly available REST backends that can be accessed by an (Android) app.


### What is Firebase?

 

###  Elaborate why interfacing with a backend should be a-synchronously (i.e. not on the UI thread) rather than synchronously.


###  In level 4 demo we have shown the use of AsyncTask for manipulating an Sql local database. Similarly we can interface with a backend. Once a JSON stream is received from that backend, it is possible to analyse it by decomposition of that JSON stream, using all the keywords and parameters present in that stream. That is a cumbersome process. Explain what the Retrofit and Gson libraries can do for you.
